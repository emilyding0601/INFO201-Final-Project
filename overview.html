      We have decided to analyze some of the most important factors involved with a decision to
      aplly for admission to a college. Admission rates give an idea of how many students are
      accepted out of how many have applied. SAT scores provide the average SAT score for students
      admitted to the university. SAT scores are only one aspect of the admissions process. One of
      the most notable factors is the cost of attendance. Also, we wanted to explore the diversity
      among the universities.
